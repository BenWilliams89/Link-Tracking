Here is my idea:

- End goal = user has a link that I produce and uses it for their main social media link

- The link will produce a automated email saying how many clicks occured that day/week/month - one link = free
    - Extra features being adding extra reports & more then one link for each social media channel = multiple links/reports = paid

- The link will be a UTM from google analytics

- Questions to answer:
    - Will a user need a GA account already or can I create one for them when they sign up to my link
        - will chatgpt etc help to automate a user to create a account from within my software
    
    - What details/user information do I need to capture when a user signs up to my software
        - fname, lname, email, google property id, socila media accounts - LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter to start

    - What databases and ERD is required when storing the information 

    - What is the offer I will present on my website

    - What are the use cases of why people would use the app
